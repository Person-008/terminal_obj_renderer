# terminal_obj_renderer
python code to display .obj files in terminal, does't work on windows cmd and powershell, works on gnome-terminal, not tested on anything else

this was generally just for me to learn 3d rendering basics, some things are implemented in a weird way, but i still learned a lot

## controls

only shows anything after any input, you will probably also want to zoom out in the terminal

keys were partly chosen at random

wasd to move around  
y and x to go up/down  
o to switch between rendering modes  
r to switch between projection modes  
1 - 9 to load models (only 1 - 3 actually load unique models, the others load model 1)  
arrow keys to rotate camera  
q to quit  
l / k to rotate the light direction  
j to show mask of rendered geometry
